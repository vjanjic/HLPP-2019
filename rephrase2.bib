  abstract = "We present a new programming model for deterministic parallel computation in a pure functional language. The model is monadic and has explicit granularity, but allows dynamic construction of dataflow networks that are scheduled at runtime, while remaining deterministic and pure. The implementation is based on monadic concurrency, which has until now only been used to simulate concurrency, rather than to provide parallelism, in functional languages. We present the API with its semantics, and argue that parallel execution is deterministic. Furthermore, we present a complete work-stealing scheduler implemented as a Haskell library, and we show that it performs at least as well as the existing parallel programming models in Haskell."

Implemented as a shallow embedding in Haskell, it provides a message-passing communication model, inspired by Erlang, without introducing incompatibility with Haskell's established shared-memory concurrency. A key contribution is a method for serializing function closures for transmission across the network. Cloud Haskell has been implemented; we present example code and some preliminary performance measurements."

model in which a network of steps (functions) communicate
through message-passing as well as a limited form of shared memory.
This paper describes a new implementation of CnC for Haskell.
Compared to existing parallel programming models for Haskell,
CnC occupies a useful point in the design space: pure and deterministic
like Strategies, but more explicit about granularity and
the structure of the computation, which affords the programmer
greater control over parallel performance. We present results on 4,
32, and 48-core machines demonstrating parallel speedups ranging
between 7X and 22X on non-trivial benchmarks.
